Introduction
------------
This repository contains several programs that I use for my NAS (Network
Attached Storage) at home.

They are provided as FOSS in the hope that they are useful.

Programs
--------

 revoke — webapp for easily revokable (secret) key sharing
 dramaqueen — shuts down the NAS once nobody is using it anymore
 dornröschen — wakes up machines/NASen to backup/sync
 avr-x1100w — orchestrates A/V receiver
 runstatus — exposes via HTTP whether a process is running

Building
--------

Simply use:

    go get github.com/stapelberg/zkj-nas-tools/revoke

And you’ll have the binary in $GOPATH/bin/

License
-------

Unless otherwise stated, all programs are published under the license found in
the file LICENSE (BSD 3-clause).
